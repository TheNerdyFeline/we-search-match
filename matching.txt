Matching Logic

GPA
  -let prof decide importance?
       -very min+
       -somewhat -.25+
       -not really -1+ or -.5+?
  - or simply min+?
  - if meets min gets added to potentialArr

Research Interest
   - need to add validation, split by comma
   - how many match?
   - should it be a pre-made list they check off?
   - only related to major/field?

Live
   - ask how far away to find match?
   - how does willing to move play in?
   - does this get answered by if switching university?

Achieve
   - is this the same as carreer aspiration?
   - shoudl it be a pre-made list to match what prof wants for students?

Hours
   - should we ask the prof how many a hours a student needs to be available instead of how many they are? see if matches?

University
   - ask prof if student need to be currently enrolled or switching?
   - instead of willing move?

Year
   - ask prof what min year student needs to be?
   - add grad school, masters, phd levels

Major
   - ask prof if major needs to match their field
     	 - yes adds more weight
	 - maybe adds medium weight
	 - no base weight
